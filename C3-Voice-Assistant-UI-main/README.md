# C3 Voice Assistant: Accessible LLM Apps for Everyone

Welcome to C3 Voice Assistant, a project that brings the power of Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) within reach of everyone, particularly emphasizing accessibility. My goal is to democratize access to advanced AI technologies, ensuring inclusivity for users who may face challenges with traditional text-based interfaces.


## Demo Features
- **Voice Activation**: Just say "C3" to activate the assistant.
- **General Queries**: Ask any question as you would with a standard LLM.
- **Document-Based Responses (RAG)**: Get answers related to specific documents. Current deployment supports queries about Nvidia's FYE 2023 10K report. You can choose to have multiple documents loaded as required.
- **Accessibility Focused**: The design philosophy prioritizes accessibility, catering to a diverse user base with different needs and preferences.
- **Vercel Deployment**: Check out the production version on Vercel.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend**: Custom-built React.js application.
- **LLM Backend**: Python Flask, leveraging LlamaIndex's 'Create Llama' feature.
- **Hosting**: API server on Render.com and frontend on Vercel.

## API Server Details
- The C3 Voice Assistant's backend is a separate, deployable Python Flask application, which interfaces with LLMs to process and respond to user queries. It is deployed using the wonderful and easy to use [create-llama](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-llama?activeTab=readme) feature by Llamaindex.
- My [API Server](https://github.com/AI-ANK/c3-python-nostream) repo
